# Cyber Space Debris

Running software "in the cloud" gives tremendous flexibility in hosting:
servers can be flexibly rented and discarded as needed.

We rent a server and just listen for connections.

Hackers scanning for vulnerable targets, or bona fide clients looking to reach
previous tenants? We visualize them all, giving a fascinating view of the
debris floating around in cyber space.
